# CSV-backed OpenAI Chatbot

This repository contains a simple Flask web application that answers questions using the OpenAI API and context pulled from CSV files. The included `data/faq.csv` file provides sample FAQ entries for testing.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app listens on port `8000` by default. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the chatbot.

## How it works

- CSV files inside the `data/` directory are loaded at startup.
- When a message is submitted, the server selects the top matching FAQ entries using a lightweight string similarity check.
- The selected rows are sent as context to the OpenAI chat completion API. If there is not enough data to answer, the bot will say so.

## Deployment

For production, run the app behind a process manager (e.g., systemd, Supervisor) or containerize it. Set the `PORT` environment variable to override the default listening port.
